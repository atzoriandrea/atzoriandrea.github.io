Iâ€™m a Ph.D. Student in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy. <br>

During my time as a Ph.D. student, I am blessed to be mentored and supervised by <a href="https://www.unica.it/unica/page/en/mirko_marras">Dr. Mirko Marras </a> and
<a href="https://unica.it/unica/en/ateneo_s07_ss01.page?contentId=SHD30371">Prof. Gianni Fenu</a>.

My research interests range from machine learning to biometrics, putting particular focus on fairness and privacy in facial biometric systems and explainable AI,
